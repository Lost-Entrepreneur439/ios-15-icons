iOS 15 icons for past versions of iOS

iOS 15 icons is an theme for jailbroken devices designed to bring the icons used in iOS 15 to earlier versions of iOS. It works with Anemone on iOS 7-11, should also work with iOS 12-14 with SnowBoard however this is untested. Completely unsure about support for iOS 6 and earlier.
